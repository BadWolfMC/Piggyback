Improved config clarity
Additional config Options
Config now auto-updates itself with new default settings if new config options are added while retaining your old settings for existing options.
Plugin now checks spigot for updates on load
SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and H2 database support added, Async wherever possible
Postgre and H2 need their respective jars placed in /PiggyBack/lib/ to function, or there is
an option to autoDownloadLibs from Maven Central Repo, disabled by default so you're not downloading
anything you don't want.
Improved Language file support
Now able to customize ALL plugin command names in Language file
Async accessing of player UUID's when toggling offline players as OP/Admin (/pback toggle 'playername')
Optional Far throwing of mobs when carrying and running added.
Ability to change blacklist to whitelist added
More explanation of how the blacklists work
Added a require certain item option in config. Currently, this just uses a certain material type. I will add
more stringent requirements if this is something people are interested in,
