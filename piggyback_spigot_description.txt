Ever wanted to CARRY pigs around like a BADASS?! Ever wanted a SLIME as PET?! TIRED of Wheat and Leads?! Your FRIEND doesn't want to come with YOU?!
Then this is the Plugin for you!

Piggyback has been around for 8 years now, and as a result, is probably more stable, and more complete, than most other stackers! Piggyback is fully configurable and can be used in Survival mode as well as Lobbies, and actually started out as a survival stacker.

=== How to Use ===

Search for a mob you want to carry.
Come close to the mob (at least 5 blocks).
Crouch and right click/left click(configurable) on the mob!(Players may turn off ability to be picked up, and config option to turn off for NPCs)
To stop carrying the mob or player, you just crouch and right click/left click on the mob again

Players with their toggle off may not be picked up by other players or pick up other players, but can still pick up Mobs. You can use this plugin in survival, or use it as a Stacker plugin for a lobby! All of the messages are customizable, and can even be completely disabled or toggled off by the user for an immersive experience!

=== ToDo ===

* Config - ItemInHand: true/false - if this is true, players can pick entities up while holding something. If it's false, you must have an empty hand when picking entities up.
* Config - Allowed entities list
* Config - Custom displayname of entities Exclusion list

=== How you can help ===

I'll try to keep this list updated. ;)
